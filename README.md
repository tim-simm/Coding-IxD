# Welcome to the Project Eigenform
## *Better understand your self-perception*

The project "Eigenform"  from [Coding IxD](https://codingixd.mi.fu-berlin.de/expandingthebody/) explored the quantitative and qualitative aspects of body self-image people encounter.

## Project Description
### General Information
Every day, we come across the 'ideal’ body, for example, on social media. However, the focus of such media tends to centre around the perfect shape and form of bodies. Despite this emphasis, these idealized body images might fail to capture the diversity of our people's sentiments. As a result, they contribute to a skewed self-perception based on universalized or generalized human bodies.

Motivated by this observation, Eigenform challenges conventional notions of self-perception by translating numeric values and emotional well-being into tangible forms. Rather than presenting precise values, the Eigenform object embodies tendencies without assigning judgments. It incorporates a carefully designed kinematic mechanism, physicalized in three individually expandable and contractible rings. Every user receives a unique representation of their body data, collected by a scale and our questionnaire. The rings' expansion and contraction metaphorically illustrate the potential gap between numerical data (like a weight on a scale) and people's body perception.

Eigenform serves as a medium for discussion to provoke reflection by teasing societal tendencies toward self-optimization. Ultimately, Eigenform reminds us how we should think about our bodies.

### Website
We created a website for the interaction and the questionnaire. This website guides the user through our project. The website has the following structure: 
At the beginning, a counter runs down, with which the interaction begins. The users stand on a scale and are weighed.
This is followed by explanations and an example of how the questionnaire is structured. 

The main interaction is the questionnaire. We have come up with a special design for the questionnaire, which is widely used and interesting. The questionnaire consists of yes/no questions and is answered by swiping to the left or right. 
In addition to the questions, the user has to indicate his age and height.

A body type is then calculated using an algorithm. We differentiate between:
* Body Neutrality
* Body Positivity
* Body Negativity

The results are stored in an SQL database.

We worked with the Vue.js library for the interaction. The database queries with PHP, HTML for the pages and CSS for the style. The web application runs on a web server provided by the FU-Berlin, but it is also possible on every other server.
